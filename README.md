# solar-limb

The main aim of this work was the determination of the Sun effective temperature and for doing this, we made observations 
and performed data analysis. However, the same steps were already undertaken by our predecessors, that is why in the current 
work we concentrated mostly on the software improvement and created a self-consistent GUI application which will help to easily 
solve similar tasks in future. In this section we discuss this in more detail.
